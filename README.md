As the consequences and long-term effects of global CO2 emissions have become prominent, many companies and countries are trying to do their part by working toward climate control and carbon neutrality. Another big factor in helping climate change is making the change from meat-based food options to plant-based and vegan food options. Not only does this diet have a benefit for your personal health but the impact on the environment is just as great. Our module will allow for people who live in New Jersey, or are thinking about moving here, to see how we are doing in terms of sustainability and if there is a certain town or county that is leading the pack.

The issue we want to address is part of the larger issue of climate change and sustainability. Eating foods involving animal products and other harmful elements has more of an impact on the environment than say vegan options. We want to solve the issue of some people not being aware of these options or being able to find that.
